Iâ€™ll tell you everything you need to know about adding Stripe to a flutter app.

We will use Firebase & Flutter only.

There are two types of purchases 1. One-time purchase and 2. Subscription purchase in stripe. You will learn about both of them by creating two production-level apps.

In the first app, Shoe Store you will add a one-time purchase, where users can buy shoes and see their purchase & delivery history.

In the second Subscription app, you will add 2 stripe subscriptions(month & year). Users can buy & cancel subscriptions anytime. They can manage subscriptions, and see Purchase history, Invoices & all other subscription details.

So without distorting any more let's get started
